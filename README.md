# Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. The goal of this dashboard is to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization by leveraging various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and insightful visualizations.

The dashboard is structured around the following key business requirements:

1.  **Total Sales by Fat Content:** Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales. Additional KPIs explored alongside include Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating, all segmented by fat content. This analysis is visualized using a Donut Chart.

2.  **Total Sales by Item Type:** Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales. Similar to the fat content analysis, the dashboard also assesses how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary across different item types. A Bar Chart is used for this comparison.

3.  **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:** Compare total sales across different outlets, segmented by fat content. This visualization, presented as a Stacked Column Chart, also allows for the assessment of Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating variations across outlets and fat content.

4.  **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:** Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales. This trend analysis is visualized using a Line Chart.
